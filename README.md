# Exploratory Testing  

I created this repo to showcase how exploratory testing can be performed starting by the definition of a Test Charter, organizing session-based testing with multiple testers and recording observations, defects in a specific [template](https://github.com/mohammed-ibenayad/exploratory_testing_opencart/issues/new/choose).

# How to contribute to this project ?
If you're a tester and would like to develop your skills in exploratory testing process, please follow the following steps:

2. Report your encountered defects using the GitHub issues feature by clicking on create a new issue, and choosing the template **"Bug report for OpenCart report"**
3. Report your test notes using the GitHub issues  feature  by clicking on create a new issue, and choosing the template **"Test notes for OpenCart report"**

:arrow_right: We invite you to use dedicated [GitHub Issues templates](https://github.com/mohammed-ibenayad/exploratory_testing_opencart/issues/new/choose) to log your bugs and test notes.

> Happy exploratory testing!
